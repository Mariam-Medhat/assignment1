Horn of Africa;the southernmost member, the Comoros, is an island country off 
the coast of East Africa. The region stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the 
west to the Arabian Sea in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north 
to the Indian Ocean in the southeast.The eastern part of the Arab world is known 
as the Mashriq, and the western part as the Maghreb.Arabic is used as the lingua

<strong><span class="auto-style12">Malta, an island country in Southern Europe whose national language also 
derives from Arabic (through Sicilian Arabic), is not included in the region. 
Similarly, Chad, Eritrea, and Israel recognize Arabic as one of their official 
or working languages but are not included in the region because they are not 
members of the Arab League. The Arab world has a combined population of around 
422 million inhabitants and a gross domestic product of $2.782 trillion.</span></strong><span class="auto-style5">
</span>
</p>
<p><strong><span class="auto-style12">In post-classical history, the Arab world was synonymous with the 
historic Arab empires and caliphates. Arab nationalism arose in the second half 
of the 19th century along with other nationalist movements within the Ottoman 
Empire. The Arab League was formed in 1945 to represent the interests of Arab 
people and especially to pursue the political unification of the Arab countries; 
a project known as Pan-Arabism.</span></strong><span class="auto-style5">
